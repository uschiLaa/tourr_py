This works for python3, assuming that rpy2 has been installed.
The only non-base R package required is tourr, it can be installed by calling install.py.
Adding some package for color palette, maybe colorspace?
Python packages required: ConfigParser, rpy2

At the moment this is only basic implementation where the only thing read from the parameter.ini file is the path to the input file to use.
Only very basic sanity check, testing that the data frame built from input file has at least 2 columns.

UPDATE:
Added color argument, and column selection.
Now using animate_xy as color is not passed when using animate function ---- Now using animate, passing display_xy with color, pch arguments

TODO:
how to handle pch								DONE
selecting only numeric columns for dfShow					DONE
sorting of points								DONE
selecting tour type (keep guided tour for later..)				DONE
selecting rescaling or not							DONE
option of saving to GIF instead of display					DONE
do we want more than 2d scatter plots? it should be good enough for now

UPDATE REQUIREMENTS:
We save GIFs using the python package moviepy which needs to be installed separately.
Note that a common error arises as ffmpeg is not (currently) automatically installed (when installing moviepy via pip)
It can be installed e.g. using homebrew as 'brew install ffmpeg'
Note that files in the temp directory will be removed when asking to save a GIF, while png files used to generate it will not be removed after running
