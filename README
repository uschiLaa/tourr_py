This works for python3, assuming that rpy2 has been installed.
The only non-base R package required is tourr, it can be installed by calling install.py. #does this actually work?
Adding some package for color palette, maybe colorspace?
Python packages required: ConfigParser, rpy2

At the moment this is only basic implementation where the only thing read from the parameter.ini file is the path to the input file to use.
Only very basic sanity check, testing that the data frame built from input file has at least 2 columns.

UPDATE:
Added color argument, at the moment it is necessary input, should be optional, same for selecting columns.
Now using animate_xy as color is not passed when using animate function
